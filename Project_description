the "cars" project

Create a "cars" project based on Flask.
It will run a REST-API server that will enable you to create/read/update/delete (CRUD)
tasks that you have to do.
A single task should contain a title and some details:
('title':'shop', 'details':'Milk'}

This is how you should use your program using "curl":

# Get all cars
# This will use GET by default
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/cars


# This will use GET to get a specific car
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/cars/2

# This will use DELETE to delete a specific car
curl -X "DELETE" http://127.0.0.1:5000/cars/2


# Add a new task:
# (You have to specify Content-Type to send data as json)
curl  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"car_id": 6, "car_make": "Opel","car_model": "Opel", "make_year": "1985","color": "Red", "car_price": "20000$"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/cars


Use similar patterns to implement update - TODO

GET  (to read data)
POST (to create a new one)
PUT  (to update an existing one)
DELETE (to delete an existing one)
